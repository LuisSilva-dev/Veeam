Arguments consist of: Source folder location, Replica folder location, interval in seconds between each update and Logs folder location.
Ex: "C:\Users\Username\Downloads\SRC" "C:\Users\Username\Downloads\REP" 5 "C:\Users\Username\Downloads\LOG"

This implementation does not delete folders from the replica that were created in the source folder and then deleted afterwards.
